Linear Regression
The term regression is used when you try to find the relationship between variables.
In Machine Learning, and in statistical modeling, that relationship is used to predict the outcome of future events.
Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.
This line can be used to predict future values.

How it Works

Python has methods for finding a relationship between data-points and to draw a line of linear regression. No mathematics needed


R for Relationship
It is important to know how the relationship between the values of the x-axis and the values of the y-axis is, if there are no relationship the linear regression can not be used to predict anything.
This relationship - the coefficient of correlation - is called r.
The r value ranges from -1 to 1, where 0 means no relationship, and 1 (and -1) means 100% related.
Python and the Scipy module will compute this value for you, all you have to do is feed it with the x and y values.
