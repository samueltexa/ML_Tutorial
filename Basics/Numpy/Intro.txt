NumPy(Numerical Python)

NumPy is a Python library.
NumPy is used for working with arrays.

Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?
NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.
This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
